conclusions = """
1. CORE FINDING: LLMs lack coherent physics models
   - Detection ranges from -1.933 to 7.782 (9.7 point range!)
   - No systematic pattern across physics types
   - Success appears driven by linguistic cues, not physics understanding

2. EVIDENCE AGAINST SIMPLE EMBODIMENT GAP:
   - Some "obvious" violations are missed (gravity: -0.506)
   - Some subtle violations are caught (clothing: 7.782)
   - Cross-modal tests perform WORSE than explicit tests
   
3. THE REAL GAP IS DEEPER:
   - Models have statistical correlations, not causal models
   - Context effects dominate ("Naturally," changes gravity detection!)
   - Word frequency likely drives most "understanding"

4. IMPLICATIONS FOR AI SAFETY:
   - Models can't be trusted for physical reasoning
   - They may confidently assert physically impossible things
   - The gap isn't fixable with more text data

5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:
   - Test causal intervention understanding
   - Examine force dynamics (Talmy, 1988)
   - Compare to developmental trajectories (not just endpoints)
