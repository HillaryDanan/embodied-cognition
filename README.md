# Embodied Cognition Gap in Language Models

Testing whether LLMs lack fundamental physical intuitions that human infants possess.

## Core Hypothesis
Language models trained on text alone cannot detect physics violations that 6-month-old infants naturally recognize (Spelke et al., 1992; Baillargeon, 2004).

## Theoretical Foundation
- Infant cognition research: Spelke & Kinzler (2007), Core knowledge systems
- Embodied cognition: Barsalou (2008), Grounded cognition
- Symbol grounding: Harnad (1990), The symbol grounding problem

## Planned Experiments
1. Object permanence violations
2. Gravity/support violations  
3. Conservation violations
4. Causal impossibilities

## Method
Using retroactive update measurements from [retroactive-causality](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/retroactive-causality) work to quantify detection of physical anomalies.

## Status
Project started September 2025
Initial focus: Physics violations that infants detect
