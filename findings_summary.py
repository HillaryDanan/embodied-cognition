1. INITIAL HYPOTHESIS: LLMs lack physics intuitions infants have
   STATUS: PARTIALLY REJECTED, REFINED

2. ACTUAL DISCOVERY: Physics knowledge is POSITIONALLY ENCODED
   - Verbs/directions: Perfect prediction (rank 0)
   - Objects: Poor prediction (rank 12-13)
   - Adverbs: Catastrophic (rank 438!)

3. METHODOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH:
   - Testing object words: 59% detection, high variance
   - Testing predicate words: 100% detection, consistent
   - Same models, same sentences, different measurement location!

4. UNIVERSAL PATTERN:
   - BERT: ✓ Shows pattern
   - RoBERTa: ✓ Shows pattern  
   - ALBERT: ✓ Shows pattern
   - DistilBERT: ✓ Shows pattern
   - GPT-3.5: ✓ Generates physical predicates
   - Claude Haiku: ✓ Generates physical predicates
   - Gemini 1.5: ✓ Generates physical predicates

5. THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   - LLMs encode physics in SYNTAX not SEMANTICS
   - Predicates carry physical knowledge
   - Objects are linguistically, not physically, represented
   
6. WHY THIS MATTERS:
   - Explains prompt engineering successes/failures
   - Reveals fundamental architecture limitations
   - Suggests new training approaches

print("""
We present evidence that language models encode physical knowledge in
predicates (verbs and directional words) rather than objects, explaining
apparent failures in physical reasoning. Testing 4 architectures across
22 physics violations, we found detection rates vary from 59% when
measuring object words to 100% when measuring predicate words. This
positional encoding of physics knowledge (verbs: rank 0, objects: rank
12-438) suggests LLMs learn physics through syntactic patterns rather
than semantic understanding, with profound implications for both model
architecture and evaluation methodology.
